        <h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
        <h5>In basic terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined steps or rules that you need to follow to obtain a pre-determined result. 
            For instance, when we talk about algorithms in computer programming, we already have our input and we know the expected output. 
            Now, an algorithm would be all the defined steps to follow on the input to get the desired output.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, the entire algorithm flowchart would have three major components:<br>
            <br>
                1. Input: What we already know or the things we have to begin with.<br>
                2. Algorithm: A set of sequenced steps that we need to follow one by one.<br>
                3. Output: The expected results we need to achieve in the end.<br>
            <br>
            Apart from mathematics or computer programming, we see algorithms in everyday life. 
            Letâ€™s say you want to cook a dish. Now, you can begin with some ingredients (the input) and will follow the recipe. 
            The recipe will have different steps (the algorithm) that you can follow to make the dish (the output).

        </h5>
        <h3>Different types of Algorithms?</h3>
        <h5>
            The different forms of algorithms are:<br>
            <br>
            Brute force algorithm: This is the most common type in which we devise a solution by exploring all the possible scenarios.<br>
            <br>
            Greedy algorithm: In this, we make a decision by considering the local (immediate) best option and assume it as a global optimal.<br>
            <br>
            Divide and conquer algorithm: This type of algorithm will divide the main problem into sub-problems and then would solve them individually.<br>
            <br>
            Backtracking algorithm: This is a modified form of Brute Force in which we backtrack to the previous decision to obtain the desired goal.<br>
            <br>
            Randomized algorithm: As the name suggests, in this algorithm, we make random choices or select randomly generated numbers.<br>
            <br>
            Dynamic programming algorithm: This is an advanced algorithm in which we remember the choices we made in the past and apply them in future scenarios.<br>
            <br>
            Recursive algorithm: This follows a loop, in which we follow a pattern of the possible cases to obtain a solution.<br>
